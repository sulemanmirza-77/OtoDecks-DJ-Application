# OtoDecks-DJ-Application

# Introduction
OtoDecks is an advanced DJ application designed to allow users to mix music seamlessly using tracks from different sources. Built using C++ and leveraging the JUCE framework, this application offers robust audio processing and an intuitive graphical user interface. This project served as an exploration into the principles of object-oriented programming and the potential of open-source frameworks, enhancing my understanding and skills in software development in an audio context.

# Features
**- Audio Playback Controls:** Play, pause, and repeat functionalities with dynamic waveform display.

**- Dual-Deck Interface:** Load and control two separate tracks simultaneously, each with individual controls.

**- Advanced Audio Manipulation:** Includes controls for volume, balance, bass, treble, frequency, and playback speed.

**- Drag and Drop:** Simplified interaction through drag and drop capabilities for loading tracks.

**- Library Management:** Import your music collection, search through it, and manage playlists with persistence of session data.

**- Track Metadata Display:** Shows detailed information like track title, length, and file management options.

# Technical Details
**- JUCE Framework:** Utilized for GUI and audio backend, supporting complex audio software requirements.

**- C++ Programming:** Object-oriented design patterns implemented for robust and maintainable code structure.

**- Custom Components:** Developed several custom components for deck control, waveform visualization, and library management.


# Project Structure
**- GUI Components:** Modular design with classes for deck GUIs, playlist management, and track information.

**- Audio Handling:** Classes dedicated to audio file management, playback control, and effects processing.

**- Persistence:** Functions to save and load user data and settings, ensuring a seamless user experience.

# Usage
- OtoDecks is designed for both novice users and experienced DJs, providing powerful tools and an easy-to-navigate interface for all levels of audio mixing enthusiasts.

# Installation
- Details on how to compile and run OtoDecks on your system are provided in the accompanying documentation. Ensure that you have the JUCE dependencies configured on your machine.
  
# System Requirements
First, specify the necessary operating system (Windows, macOS, Linux) and any system prerequisites such as a certain amount of RAM, a specific CPU, or graphics capabilities if relevant.

# Dependencies
List any libraries or frameworks that need to be installed beforehand. For the OtoDecks DJ Application built with the JUCE framework, users would need:

- JUCE - A comprehensive C++ framework used for building audio applications. This can be downloaded from the JUCE website.
- C++ Development Environment - An IDE like Visual Studio for Windows, Xcode for macOS, or an appropriate setup on Linux (e.g., GCC compiler and Make).
- Downloading the Application
- Provide instructions on how to obtain the application, whether itâ€™s through cloning a Git repository, downloading a zip file, or another method. For a GitHub project, it might look like this:

# Building the Application
Detailed steps on how to compile the application. For a JUCE-based project:

1. Open the Projucer: Launch the Projucer application included with JUCE.
2. Open the Project: Navigate to File > Open and select the .jucer project file in your downloaded repository.
3. Set Configuration: Configure the build settings as necessary (debug/release, 32-bit/64-bit).
4. Save and Open IDE: Save the project and open it in your IDE using the File > Open in IDE option.

# Running the Application
Instructions on how to run the executable after building, which might vary based on the system. Typically, this involves navigating to the directory containing the built application and running an executable file directly or through a command in the terminal.
